# AgriTrack

## Project Overview

AgriTrack is a data storing and visualization site, developed with Angular Django and PostgreSQL, that aims to help farmers track to farm operations, crop yields, harvest data and etc.

This project was developed during my last internship at Cool Crops from Feb 2024 to May 2024, this oppotunity allowed me to learn more about web development and agriculture data analytics.
